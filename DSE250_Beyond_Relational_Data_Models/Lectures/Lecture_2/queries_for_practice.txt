Query examples

I. Get the title of the scenes, to get text only add /text():
<result>{
	doc("j_caesar.xml")//PLAY/ACT/SCENE/TITLE/text()
}</result>

This gives the same result as above, but it is very expensive
<result>{
	doc("j_caesar.xml")//SCENE/TITLE
}</result>

This gives the same result as above, but less efficient since it gets all results and then filters
<result>{
	doc("j_caesar.xml")//TITLE[parent::SCENE]
}</result>

II. Titles of scenes where Caesar speaks
<result>{
	doc("j_caesar.xml")//SCENE/TITLE[../SPEECH/SPEAKER/text() = "CAESAR"]
}</result>

Same result but filter down first and then return titles
<result>{
	doc("j_caesar.xml")//SCENE[SPEECH/SPEAKER/text() = "CAESAR"]/TITLE
}</result>
