Sampling 
*/
/* 1.1 Random Sample */

SELECT c.*
FROM customers AS c
ORDER BY random()
LIMIT 1000

/* 1.2 Repeatable Random Sample */
-- Generate a 10% random sample of the customers table, such that it can be reproduced at a later point of time
SELECT setseed(0.5);
SELECT *
FROM customers 
WHERE random() < 0.1

-- Without repetition
SELECT setseed(0.5);

/* 1.3 Proportional Stratified Sample */

/* 1.4 Balanced Sample */
-- Generate a random sample consisting of 1000 customers that has equal number of male and female customers i.e., with 1:1 gender ratio
WITH cust AS (

/* 
Table Sample 
*/
/* 2.1 System & Bernoulli */
-- Generate a 10% random sample of the customers table, such that it can be reproduced at a later point of time.
-- SYSTEM - which does block level sampling. It groups a set of tuples and randomly selects these groups.
SELECT * 
FROM customers
TABLESAMPLE SYSTEM(10) REPEATABLE(200);
-- BERNOULLI - which does tuple level sampling. Each row has equal probability of being selected.
SELECT * 
FROM customers
TABLESAMPLE BERNOULLI(10) REPEATABLE(200);

/* 2.2 Systen Rows and Comparind Efficiency */
-- Generate a random sample consisting of 1000 rows from the customers table and compare the query execution times
EXPLAIN ANALYSE
SELECT * 
FROM customers
ORDER BY random()
LIMIT 1000
-- vs. tablesample:
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "tsm_system_rows";
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT * 
FROM customers 
TABLESAMPLE SYSTEM_ROWS(1000)
-- this is much more efficient than using just random (~100 ms) vs. system (~14 ms)

/* 
Histogram 
*/
